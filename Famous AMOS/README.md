## Description

Cortex XDR has been flagging alerts non-stop this Friday due to a suspicious file being downloaded by Zhu Yuan. Thankfully, my Wireshark was running so we managed to track down some of the malicious activity. It seems like the user received a malicious attachment from an unknown domain via email, and executed it in their machine.

Note: This challenge doesn't have any questions but the flag itself!
