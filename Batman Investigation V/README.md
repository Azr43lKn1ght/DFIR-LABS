Hello This is a prepaid call from Bruce!....Bruce Thomas Wayne, An inmate at the Arkham Detention Facility.
To accept this call, press zero. To refuse this call, hang up or press one.

** presses zero **

Bruce: "YO Whassup my brother!"

Jean-Paul: "Whassup my brother! Talk to me what's the word?"

Bruce: "I ain't doin' shit man!, just pushing more peter, more sweeter, more completer than any peter pusher around,
See what I'm sayin', twin? Ha"

** Monitoring cop leaves the room **

Bruce: "Azrael!! are you making any progress! I need my way out of here, I am stuck here as Bruce!"

Jean-Paul: "Yes Bats, I got to Harley's place after I tapped their comms. I got the Evidence but
its corrupted, caught her copying that, it should be recoverable! so with Grayson in it, we will get it recovered"

Bruce: "It's not just the evidence, it's the whole operation, I need to know what's going on, 
what did you find out about where Joker hides it?"

Jean-Paul: "I heard him tellin' Harley that he's stored in a safe vault and made sure 
only he can fix it!, not sure what he is up to!"

Bruce: "Alright, I need you get the safe vault contents to Batwing, he will get 
that to Mr.Fox and I can be out of this urnfield!"

Jean-Paul: "We have a pronblem, you will have to hang on longer!, Joker told Harley 
that he deleted the saved password!, but Cassandra should get it sorted!"

Bruce: "So I will be out of here in no time! Maybe an hour!"

Jean-Paul: "Yes but what makes you so sure of that?"

Bruce: "Faith Valley Faith!, I know you all, just do what a man gotta do, Who is after Joker?" 

Jean-Paul: "Duke, Jason and Kate are on it, Alfred got em covered with backups and support,
we will get this Wayne Chemicals case sorted, Joker's ransomware is a piece of cake, we will
get it sorted, just hang on! We will get the evidence that it was joker who is behind the compromise
and who sold it to the scarecrow mafia which is beind the attack in metropolis!"

Bruce: "How did he manage to now leave any major trace, someone is behind him, 
it's crazy that he nearly got us close this time!"

Jean-Paul: "We are nearly there!, I will get you out in 10!"

** Monitoring Cop enters the room **

Bruce: "Yeah mate! no worries, I will be waiting for you to get me out of here,
I am not going to be here for long,Butcher's hook! I want out sooner! 
Can't a working man be free in this country!"

Jean-Paul: "Yeah mate, we will get em coals and coke!"

** Hangs up **

Cop: "Mate! whoever the Kr4zy guy is, he got you in a tight spot, you better get him sooner!"
