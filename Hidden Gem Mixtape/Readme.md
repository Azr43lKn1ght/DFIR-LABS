## Description
We're pretty sure there's been a hack into our system. The incident is suspected to be caused by an employee opening a document file received via email even though he deleted it shortly afterwards.

### Questions

you can either directly answer it or you can solve the challenge by running main.py in Solution folder and answering it.

```
Q1) We managed to do a logical acquisition of data from his hard drive. However, when we open the document file, it looks empty, can you analyze what it contains? format: idek{...}

Q2) We suspect multiple accounts were compromised. The attacker moved laterally. Therefore, the credentials that he used to move laterally must have leaked. Let's analyze the sequence of actions taken by the attacker and tell us what he has obtained for later purposes? Note: The flag is wrapped and divided into 2 parts. format: idek{...}

Q3) We tried to collect more network data for analysis, but because of the late approach, we only had data for a short period of time before we detected the attack and performed a shutdown of all machine at about 19:00 UTC. However I hope it can help you to answer the question whether the attacker has access to our important data? format: idek{...}
```

### Solution

The solution as well as the flag can be found in the same folder, but it's advised to finish all the questions before checking the solution.
